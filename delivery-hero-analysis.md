# Rider Utilization Rate (UTR) Improvement Strategy

## Goal
**Increase Rider Utilization Rate (UTR)**

*UTR is defined as the number of deliveries (drops) per hour per rider.*

---

## Delivery Hero Q2 2029 Report
- Despite a fast logistics rollout, **UTR increased by 23% YoY**.
- In dense areas, **UTR increased by up to 50% YoY**.
- Improved customer experience due to a reduction in delivery times:
   - Average delivery time: **~30 minutes**.
   - Even faster delivery in dense areas.

---

## Talabat's Vision
1. Delivering an **amazing customer experience**.
2. Ensuring **fast and easy delivery to your door**.

---

## Current State and Future Goal
| Metric                          | Today (Current UTR)       | Future (Post-Strategy UTR) |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Rider Utilization Rate (UTR)**| X (Baseline UTR)          | Y (Optimal UTR)            |
| **Capacity UTR**               | Actual output / Max output| Higher efficiency          |

## Key Levers to Improve Rider UTR
### 1. **Optimize Delivery Cost**
   - Potential for reduced delivery costs due to **shorter distances** and efficient rider allocation.

### 2. **Improve Customer Experience**
   - Faster delivery times increase satisfaction and retention.

### 3. **Lower Emission Levels**
   - Reducing rider travel distances contributes to lower environmental impact.

---

## Strategy for Incremental Improvements
To achieve a **lower UTR** without transformational changes:

1. **Increase the Number of Orders Per Hour**
   - **How:** Optimize all operational levers.

2. **Optimize Rider Utilization Levers**
   - Increase utilization levels.
   - Maintain or reduce delivery times.

### **Operational Variables to Consider**
1. **Peak Times:** Lunch and dinner periods.
2. **Restaurant Density:** Number of restaurants in a zone.
   - Acquire more restaurants in dense zones to increase orders.
3. **Rider Allocation:** Number of riders allocated per hub/area.
   - Adjust allocation based on restaurant density and demand forecasts.
4. **Rider Radius:**
   - Reduce rider delivery radius.
   - Allocate riders to specific zones/hubs to improve familiarity and efficiency.

## Steps to Optimize UTR Across the SLA Chain
Improving efficiency across **all steps** of the delivery process will:
- Increase utilization levels.
- Decrease delivery times.

| **Key SLA Metrics**             |
|---------------------------------|
| Cooking time                    |
| Reaction time                   |
| Driving to vendor               |
| Time spent at vendor            |
| Driving to customer             |
| Delivering the order            |

---

## Rider Performance Assessment
### **Current Issues**
- Rider **no-shows** and **late-shows** impacting delivery times and UTR.

### **Performance Metrics**
1. **Idle Time:** Time riders spend waiting for the next order.
   - Identify underutilized or overutilized riders:
     - **Under 5 minutes**: Rider is **over-utilized**.
     - **Above 20 minutes**: Rider is **under-utilized**.

2. **Hourly Analysis:** Assess rider performance during peak times (lunch and dinner shifts).

3. **Bucketing System** to evaluate optimal utilization:
   - Efficiently group and assess idle times.

## Strategy Outcomes and Benefits
| **Outcome**                        | **Benefit**                                  |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Increased Rider Utilization Levels | Higher delivery efficiency                  |
| Reduced Idle Time                  | Lower operational costs                     |
| Improved Delivery Times            | Enhanced customer experience                |
| Rider Familiarity in Zones         | Faster deliveries, lower emissions          |
| Optimized Rider Allocation         | Better resource planning and scalability    |

---

## Future Directions
- Incremental implementation of strategies.
- Leverage technology-driven optimizations for fleet management.
- Continue to track **key UTR metrics** and rider performance.

---

## How to Calculate Optimal UTR
- Assess idle time per rider shift.
- Identify performance gaps using the **bucketing system**:
  - Underutilized: >20 minutes idle time.
  - Overutilized: <5 minutes idle time.
- Adjust rider allocation and delivery radii dynamically.

---

## Conclusion
By incrementally optimizing rider utilization levers, Talabat can:
- Increase rider efficiency.
- Improve customer satisfaction.
- Reduce delivery costs and emissions.

This approach ensures **sustainable growth** in UTR while enhancing operational performance and customer experience.
